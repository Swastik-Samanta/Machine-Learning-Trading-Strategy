# Machine-Learning-Trading-Strategy
This is a simple Machine Learning based Trading Strategy, and takes in and cleans data from CSV files from yahoo finance. I create independent variables such as Open-Close price difference and High-Low price difference and split this data set into training and testing sets. I also created another independence variable y, which was an array of 0s and 1s in which the 1s indicated tomorrow's stock price being higher than that day. Then I used Support Vector Classifier in order to create a Machine Learning model and used the train and test data sets. The model created a prediction column of 1s and 0s in which 1s indicates to buy the stock and 0s indicate to hold or sell. To check its returns vs a traditional buy and hold strategy, I calculated the returns of the stock as well as the projected returns with this strategy and plotted a graph displaying this information.
